# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, I have cloned Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository, and have made the following changes using HTML and CSS.


## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. I changed the color of the background on the student groups page to a dark gray page which I decided to do after a little bit of research. A dark background forces the user to focus to the attention to the brighter content which limits distraction, and adds contrast. If I were to completely redesign the site I'd make the background dark and play around with the content colors to match the background. A div that I changed a little bit was the Nav div, because it was crunched together too much, and not an attractive color with the brownish link color. I spread the line spacing out a little bit to fill more white space, and changed the link color to Spartan green for an MSU theme. Adding more left margin shifted the nav to the right to look centered, making the website appear more organized.

2. Font change: I changed the font to Monsterrat (a different Google font) that is a widely used font in the UI/UX field on different websites. This font features friendly, open curves that create a more natural reading rhythym. Feedback from classmates and roommates helped determine that this was a font that multiple users would enjoy reading. This font overall feels more enjoyable to read as it is a little spaced out more, and not as boring feeling as a normal sans font.

3. The two images that I included in the website were one, an image of a screen with code written on it to represent the class itself 'Web Authoring', which gives the user a little bit of a preview of what this class is about. Since the website lacked images that represented what the site is for. The second image was a portrait photo of Dr. Monberg, which is located on the contact page. I thought this image was a cruicial one to have on the website because as a student myself, I like to look at who my professors are before beginning the class, and this shows me what to expect and adds a little bit more personality to the site as you see who it is created by. 

4. Grading Scale table: I changed the origional layout of the grading scale which was all squished together, with no labels or anything; into a more user friendly table which has the labels - "Grade" and "Points" which allow for an easier time reading the grading scale. Through a little bit of research, I found that users prefer looking through data that is presented in a spaced out fashion, rather than squished together, so I spaced out the table for that reason. Overall I didn't feel the need to decorate the table with anything fancy, but just kept the style similar to the websites style.

5. The original student groups page was anything but appealing for any type of user. The new style group page features each group in its own separate div box instead of having them all jumbled together. I also lined the names up vertically in a list rather than side by side for easy reading, with a group name featured above the student names. Finally, I changed the links to each name to a bold Spartan green font since these are students who represent the university, so I wanted to emphasize these names pretty well. 

6. For the schedule webpage that was missing navigation, I added the same side nav bar that was featured on all of the other pages to keep consistency, but the nav bar includes the changes that are mentioned above on step '2'. I considered a horizontal nav bar on top but I thought the vertical one looked better and matched the columns layout of the schedule.

7. Since nothing on the schedule page was really separated, I included a border around each box for the grid, which separates rows horizontally and vertically. I kept the colors of the origional columns because I just found the color scheme attractive but I altered the width of each column to get a more asthetically pleasing feel that makes the schedule look organized. Adding a border radius for each box gives it a look that I found sort of cool and helped separate the content even more, which was a main issue with the original. Finally, I moved the WRA 410 Schedule title over to the left which gave the schedule a professional look, and reduced the font size of the original that was too much 'in your face'.
