# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, I have cloned Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.


## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.

2. Font change: I changed the font to Roboto (a different Google font) that is a widely used font in the UI/UX field on different websites. This font features friendly, open curves that create a more natural reading rhythym. Feedback from classmates and roommates helped determine that this was a font that multiple users would enjoy reading.

3. Include two images.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  

6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.


## Grading Criteria
